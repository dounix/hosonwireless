#Hoson PrintExp on a raspberry Pi

PrintExp(win32) is a program for Hoson n10 and other hoson print controller boards.

Hoson boards have their own control protocol, not listening on port 9100 directly.

PrintExp is the translator/configuration UI for Hoson Boards.

It provides a configuration interface, and also listens on port 9100 on the hosting windows PC.
